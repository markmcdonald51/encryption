== Encryption



== Introduction

A simple and useful way to encrypt strings. Useful for encrypting
strings in emails with urls links.

Usage
  encrypted_string = Encryption.encrypt_aes('some string')
  string = Encryption.decrypt_aes(encrypted_string)
  
  
  Can also be used in object form
  
  e = Encryption.new
  cipher_text  = e.encrypt_aes('some string to encrypt')
  e.decrypt_aes(cipher_text)
  
  I use configatron (available at github) to set the @@encryption_key however you could just as well add your own simple string here. I also considered making this key accessible via a writer, but decided against it as this could get confusing. Please let me know if you use this or find it useful! Thanks --mark
